->For evaluating prefix we have to iterate from the right side and add elements to the stack
->when we encounter any operators then we just have two pop the two aboe elements from the stack and perform that particular operation
 on the two popped operands of that stack then push that value back into the stack
 -> after iterating return the top of the stack simply.


q => 2 4 3 1
step1: 
st => 1 3 4 2
step2: 
q=> 1 3 4 2
step3:
st=> 3 1
q=> 4 2
step4:
q=> 4 2 3 1
step5:
st=>2 4
q=> 3 1
